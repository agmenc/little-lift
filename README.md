little-lift
-----------

Clone or unzip little-lift locally, and use it as the starting point for a Lift project. Features:
* Anything called "Example..." is there as a demo
* Page - make a SiteMap more easily by extending Page - see ExampleStaticPage
* Agent - just a vague nod to the PAC pattern (which is not demonstrated here)
* Lijq - totally optional; write JsCmds that look like JQuery code, in Scala.

Any thoughts or suggestions about how to make this simpler and easier to use are welcome.
